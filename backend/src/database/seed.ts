    lyrics: `Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me
I once was lost, but now am found
Was blind, but now I see

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed

Through many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home`,

Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday dear [name]
Happy birthday to you

And many more
On channel four
And Scooby Doo
On channel two`,
